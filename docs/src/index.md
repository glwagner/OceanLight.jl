# OceanLight.jl Documentation

## Overview 

**OceanLight.jl** calculates the downwelling irradiance field in the upper ocean. By implementing the Monte Carlo method, this simulation achieves the path of Photons: starting from the refraction in the air-water interface, to some specific depth underneath the water body.
